CS 255 System Analysis and Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For the DriverPass project, the client was a company called DriverPass who wanted to create a cloud-based web application that helped students pass their DMV road test. 
# What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I believe I did well at determining the business requirements for DriverPass and interpreting their needs based on the provided interview with their CEO and IT manager. 
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to choose one part of my work to revise I would choose the class diagram of the system. I would improve it by adding methods for each class within the system.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted and implemented the user's needs by reviewing the DriverPass interview multiple times to ensure I was meeting all of their desired needs for the system as well as the user experience. I also considered use cases for many of my diagrams. It is important to consider the user's needs because they will be the one using the system the most, and user experience is everything because it determines whether or not the user will continue to use the system.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by considering the needs and functions of the system and how to best implement them. In the future, I will use diagramming and note-taking to analyze and design a system.
